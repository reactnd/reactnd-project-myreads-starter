# MyReads Project

The MyReads projects allows you to track books by adding them to shelves. The available shelves are Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. You can use the Search facillity to search for books by author or title and then add them to the shelves. To remove a book from the library set it's shelf to "None".

## TL;DR

To run the project:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
